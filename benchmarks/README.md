# Getting started

This is a micro benchmark suite we use to test if optimizations are paying off.
To not burden normal users with installing unnecessary deps we don't include them automatically.
If you want to run the benchmark install `benchmark` manually. `npm i -g benchmark`

Single micro-benchmarks can be executed by running `node ./benchmarks/<benchmarkName>`
